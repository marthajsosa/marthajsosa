# CrowdStrike Fusion Workflows

This repository contains a growing collection of **CrowdStrike Fusion workflows** designed to automate detection, alert enrichment, and response actions across your security stack. These workflows are built to accelerate decision-making and reduce incident response time by codifying logic in a repeatable, transparent way.

## Purpose

The purpose of this collection is to:

- Provide example workflows that demonstrate effective alert triage and automation
- Integrate logic, actions, and conditions across Falcon modules
- Enable detection-as-code practices through structured JSON schema inputs and outputs
- Offer visual documentation for workflow logic using `draw.io` diagrams

## Structure

Each workflow folder includes:

- **Input Schema (`input_schema.json`)**  
  Defines expected alert fields, values, and data structure used to trigger the workflow.

- **Output Schema (`output_schema.json`)**  
  Describes the resulting data structure, transformations, or actions executed by the workflow.

- **Workflow Diagram (`workflow.drawio`)**  
  A visual flowchart of the logic, decision branches, and response actions.
